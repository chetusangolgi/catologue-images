2. WHEN a user is taking the quiz THEN the system SHALL display background.png as the page background
3. WHEN a user views the results screen THEN the system SHALL display background.png as the page background
4. WHEN the background image is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure all text and UI elements remain clearly readable
