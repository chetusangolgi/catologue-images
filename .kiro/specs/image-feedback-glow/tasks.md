# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update getGlowClass method to prioritize feedback-based glowing


  - Modify the existing getGlowClass method in QuizGame component to check feedbackType first
  - Add logic to return green glow for correct answers and red glow for incorrect answers
  - Maintain existing selection-based glow as fallback when no feedback is shown
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_



- [ ] 2. Update getBorderColor method to support feedback-based borders
  - Enhance getBorderColor method to prioritize feedback state over selection state
  - Add green border for correct feedback and red border for incorrect feedback


  - Preserve existing selection-based border logic as secondary priority
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2, 4.2_

- [ ] 3. Test glow behavior with different answer scenarios
  - Create test cases for correct answer selection with green glow



  - Create test cases for incorrect answer selection with red glow
  - Verify glow state resets properly between questions
  - Test visual distinctness of different glow states
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 4. Verify smooth transitions and visual consistency
  - Test glow transition smoothness during feedback display
  - Ensure glow effects are clearly visible against background
  - Validate that feedback glow properly overrides selection glow
  - Confirm proper cleanup of glow state when moving to next question
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 3.1, 3.2_
